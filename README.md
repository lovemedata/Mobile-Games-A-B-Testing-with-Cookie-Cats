# Mobile-Games-A-B-Testing-with-Cookie-Cats

This is one of the projects done in Data Camp

I was able to analyse and compare 2 versions (Version A and Version B) of cookie cats to learn which is more effective.

This was done amidst players with different userid

It was also tested their retention rate after 1 day and after 7 days.

The A and B version in this project is gate_30 and gate_40

A similar version of this can be done for customers to determine those who will continue using the downloaded mobile app after days with the new or updated version.

Watch out for the next repository.
